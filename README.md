# prework-study-guide

## Description

This is a simple website I built to put all of my notes from the bootcamp prework. Building this website has taught me many key fundimentals in the foundation of building more complex websites. I learned the basics on how to write code and review it to debug and solve any issues within my code. With the skills I've learned from building this website, I hope to expand my knowledge and build better websites with more information and more usability for end users. 

## Usage

The use of this website is to help with studying topics from the prework content. Open the console for the website by right clicking on the webpage, selecting inspect, and navigating to the console tab. There, you will see the topics covered and a suggestion on what to study.
